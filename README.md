**Self in Python**
1. Represent something that belongs to the class
2. Can be used to access the variable and methods inside the same class
3. self parameter can be renamed
4. Assigning function parameters to class variable
5. Practical Demonstration


**Assigning method Parameter to class Variables using self keyword**
1. We can use self keyword in pythonto differentiate class variable from the method parameters
2. Practical Demonstration


**Initializing Class Variable Using methods in Python**
1. Create a Car and different objects
2. Using a method inside Car class to initialize the class variables
3. Practical Demonstration


**__init__ method in Python**
1. we can initiliaze the Class variables during the object creation statement itself
2. Hence initilization process is simplified with __init__ method
3. using __init__ method inside Car class to initialize the class variables
4. Practical Demonstration


**Static Variables,Static Methods,Instance Variables, Instance Methods**
1. Accessing Static Variables using Class Name
2. Instance Variables in python
3. Methods in Python
  i. Functions insie the class Python can be as methods
  ii. **Instance Methods**
      a. needs to be accesssed using the project
      b. has self keyword
   i.**Static methods**
      a. @staticmethod
      b. should not be specified with self keyword
      c. if we provide self keyword in the static methods, that will be treated as a first parameter, for which we have to pass the argument while calling it
      d. can be accessed using the Class name
4. Instance Variables and Instance Methods belong to Object Memory
5. Static Varaibles and Static Methods belong to Class Memory
6. Static Methods can only access Static Stuff


**Inheritance**
1. inheritance
   a. A child Class acquiring the properties of Parent Class
   b. Practical Demonstration of Inheritance
      Class B(A)

**Types of Inheritance**
1. Types of Inheritance
   a. single
   b. Multilevel
   c. Hierarchical - Two child classes have same parent class
   d. Multiple -  A child has two Parent classes - Class three(One.Two)
   e. Hybrid - Hierarchical + Multiple

**Polymorphism-Method Overriding**
1. polymorphism- method overriding
   a. Overriding Variable and method in python
2. Practical Demonstration
